# Lloyds Bank Matching Performance Improvements

## Problem Analysis

**Issue**: Lloyds bank matching performance was poor compared to Excel's fuzzy matching, with only a few matches found despite Excel finding 11+ matches.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Overly Strict Thresholds**
- **Confidence threshold**: 0.7 (70%) - too high
- **Description similarity**: 0.6-0.8 (60-80%) - too strict
- **Date tolerance**: 1-7 days - too restrictive
- **Amount tolerance**: 1 cent - very tight

### 2. **Complex Multi-Factor Scoring**
- **Problem**: If ANY factor failed, overall score dropped significantly
- **Excel approach**: More forgiving, focuses primarily on amount and description

### 3. **Aggressive Description Normalization**
- **Problem**: Removed important matching information (numbers, special characters)
- **Example**: "PAYROLL SALARY 12345" â†’ "payroll salary" (loses reference numbers)

### 4. **Limited Fuzzy Matching**
- **Current**: Basic difflib SequenceMatcher
- **Excel**: More sophisticated fuzzy matching algorithms

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Relaxed Thresholds**

**Optimized Reconciliation Service**:
```python
@dataclass
class ReconciliationConfig:
    confidence_threshold: float = 0.5  # Lowered from 0.7
    date_tolerance_days: int = 14      # Increased from 7
    description_similarity_threshold: float = 0.4  # Lowered from 0.6
    max_candidates_per_transaction: int = 100  # Increased from 50
```

**Basic Reconciliation Service**:
```python
def reconcile_transactions(
    score_threshold: float = 0.5,  # Lowered from 0.8
    min_description_similarity: float = 0.3,  # Lowered from 0.6
)
```

### 2. **Improved Scoring Weights**

**Before**:
```python
score = amount_score * 0.4 + desc_score * 0.3 + date_score * 0.3
```

**After**:
```python
score = amount_score * 0.5 + desc_score * 0.3 + date_score * 0.2
```

**Rationale**: Prioritize amount matching like Excel, reduce date importance.

### 3. **Enhanced Description Matching**

**New Multi-Approach Fuzzy Matching**:
1. **Basic fuzzy similarity** - Original difflib approach
2. **Partial matching** - Jaccard similarity (like Excel)
3. **Word-based matching** - Count matching words
4. **Substring matching** - With length penalty

**Improved Normalization**:
```python
def _normalize_description_improved(self, text: str) -> str:
    # Convert to lowercase and strip whitespace
    text = str(text).lower().strip()
    
    # Remove extra whitespace but preserve single spaces
    text = ' '.join(text.split())
    
    # Keep numbers and common separators that might be important for matching
    # Only remove truly problematic characters
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s\-\.]', ' ', text)
    
    return text.strip()
```

### 4. **More Forgiving Rejection Thresholds**

**Before**:
```python
if (amount_score < 0.1 or 
    date_score < 0.05 or 
    description_score < 0.1):
```

**After**:
```python
if (amount_score < 0.05 or  # Lowered from 0.1
    date_score < 0.02 or    # Lowered from 0.05
    description_score < 0.05):  # Lowered from 0.1
```

### 5. **Lower Minimum Confidence**

**Before**: `min_confidence = min(0.3, self.config.confidence_threshold)`
**After**: `min_confidence = min(0.2, self.config.confidence_threshold)`

## Expected Results

### 1. **Significantly More Matches**
- **Before**: 0-2 matches found
- **Expected**: 8-15+ matches (comparable to Excel)

### 2. **Better Description Matching**
- **Partial matches**: "PAYROLL SALARY" matches "PAYROLL SALARY 12345"
- **Word-based**: "SUPPLIER PAYMENT" matches "PAYMENT TO SUPPLIER"
- **Substring**: "REFUND" matches "REFUND RECEIVED"

### 3. **More Forgiving Date Matching**
- **Before**: 1-7 days tolerance
- **After**: 14 days tolerance
- **Special handling**: 35 days for payroll transactions

### 4. **Improved Amount Matching**
- **Sign convention**: Handles Lloyds positive debits vs ERP negative debits
- **Tolerance**: 1 cent precision maintained
- **Partial credit**: For amounts within 1-5% difference

## Configuration Options

The new system is highly configurable:

```python
# Example configuration for very permissive matching
config = ReconciliationConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.3,  # Very permissive
    description_similarity_threshold=0.2,  # Very permissive
    date_tolerance_days=30,  # Very permissive
    amount_weight=0.6,  # Prioritize amount matching
    description_weight=0.3,
    date_weight=0.1,
    enable_partial_description_matching=True
)
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run reconciliation** with Lloyds bank data
2. **Compare results** with Excel fuzzy matching
3. **Adjust thresholds** if needed using the configuration options
4. **Review matches** to ensure quality is maintained

## Files Modified

- `services/optimized_reconciliation_service.py` - Main improvements
- `services/reconciliation.py` - Basic service improvements

## Next Steps

1. Test with actual Lloyds bank data
2. Fine-tune thresholds based on results
3. Consider adding more sophisticated fuzzy matching libraries (rapidfuzz, fuzzywuzzy)
4. Add user-configurable matching parameters in the UI
