# NaN Display and Matching Issues Fix Summary

## Problems Identified

### 1. NaN Values Still Appearing in ERP Table
**Issue**: Despite data cleaning improvements, NaN values were still being displayed in the ERP transactions table UI.

**Root Cause**: The table display code was directly showing raw transaction data without proper formatting for NaN values.

### 2. Zero Matches Despite Having Candidates
**Issue**: The reconciliation process was finding 218 candidates but still producing 0 matches.

**Root Cause**: The matching algorithm had very strict thresholds that were rejecting all candidates:
- Amount score threshold: 0.5 (too high)
- Date score threshold: 0.3 (too high)  
- Description score threshold: 0.6 (too high)

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed NaN Display in ERP Table

**File Modified**: `views/widgets/erp_data_widget.py`

**Changes**:
- Added proper formatting for date values to avoid NaN display
- Added NaN handling for description and reference fields
- Added proper error handling for amount formatting
- Ensured all fields display "N/A" instead of NaN values

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Format date properly to avoid NaN display
date_str = str(transaction.date) if transaction.date else "N/A"
if hasattr(transaction.date, 'strftime'):
    date_str = transaction.date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

# Handle NaN values in description and reference
desc_str = str(transaction.description) if transaction.description and str(transaction.description) != 'nan' else "N/A"
ref_str = str(transaction.reference) if transaction.reference and str(transaction.reference) != 'nan' else ""

# Handle NaN values in amount
try:
    amount_str = f"£{float(transaction.amount):.2f}" if transaction.amount is not None and str(transaction.amount) != 'nan' else "N/A"
except (ValueError, TypeError):
    amount_str = "N/A"
```

### 2. Relaxed Matching Thresholds

**File Modified**: `services/optimized_reconciliation_service.py`

**Changes**:
- Relaxed individual score thresholds:
  - Amount score: 0.5 → 0.3
  - Date score: 0.3 → 0.1
  - Description score: 0.6 → 0.2
- Added lower confidence threshold for initial matching
- Enhanced description scoring with substring matching
- Added better NaN handling in description scoring
- Added detailed debug logging for scoring process

**Key Changes**:
```python
# Relaxed thresholds
if (amount_score < 0.3 or 
    date_score < 0.1 or 
    description_score < 0.2):
    continue

# Lower confidence threshold
min_confidence = min(0.3, self.config.confidence_threshold)

# Enhanced description scoring
if norm1 in norm2 or norm2 in norm1:
    return 0.5
```

### 3. Enhanced Debugging

**Added Features**:
- Detailed scoring logs for each candidate
- Rejection reason logging
- Better visibility into why matches are or aren't found

## Expected Results

### 1. ERP Table Display
- ✅ No more NaN values displayed in the table
- ✅ Proper formatting for dates, amounts, and text fields
- ✅ Clear "N/A" indicators for missing data

### 2. Reconciliation Matching
- ✅ More lenient matching criteria should find more matches
- ✅ Better handling of partial matches
- ✅ Detailed logging to understand matching process

### 3. Debugging Capabilities
- ✅ Clear visibility into scoring process
- ✅ Understanding of why candidates are rejected
- ✅ Better troubleshooting information

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Load ERP Data**: Verify no NaN values appear in the table
2. **Run Reconciliation**: Check logs for detailed scoring information
3. **Monitor Matches**: Should see more matches with relaxed thresholds
4. **Review Logs**: Look for debug information about candidate scoring

## Files Modified

### UI Display
- `views/widgets/erp_data_widget.py` - Fixed NaN display in ERP table

### Matching Algorithm
- `services/optimized_reconciliation_service.py` - Relaxed thresholds and enhanced scoring

## Summary

The fixes address both the immediate display issues (NaN values) and the underlying matching problems (overly strict thresholds). The relaxed matching criteria should result in more matches being found, while the improved UI formatting ensures that any remaining data quality issues are displayed clearly rather than as confusing NaN values.
