# Dependency Fix Summary - Missing psutil Module

## Problem
The application was experiencing a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psutil'` error when trying to run the performance monitoring service.

## Root Cause
The `psutil` library was being imported in `services/performance_monitor.py` but was not included in the project's requirements files.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added psutil to Requirements
**File Modified**: `requirements/base.txt`
- Added `psutil>=5.9.0` to the base requirements
- Placed it in the "Additional utilities" section alongside other system utilities

### 2. Installation Instructions
To install the missing dependency, run:
```bash
pip install psutil>=5.9.0
```

Or install all requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements/base.txt
```

## Files Modified

### Requirements
- `requirements/base.txt` - Added psutil>=5.9.0

## Verification

### Dependencies Check
✅ `psutil` added to base requirements
✅ Version constraint specified (>=5.9.0)
✅ Placed in appropriate section with other utilities

### Usage in Code
The `psutil` library is used in:
- `services/performance_monitor.py` - For system resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk usage)

## Additional Dependencies Status

### Already Included in Requirements
- `pandas>=2.2.2,<3` - Data processing
- `numpy>=1.26,<2` - Numerical computing
- `scikit-learn>=1.4` - Machine learning
- `PySide6==6.6.0` - GUI framework
- `sqlalchemy>=2.0.0` - Database ORM
- `matplotlib>=3.8.0` - Plotting
- And many others...

### No Other Missing Dependencies Found
✅ All imports in the codebase are covered by existing requirements
✅ No other `ModuleNotFoundError` patterns detected

## Installation Commands

### For Development
```bash
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

### For Desktop Application
```bash
pip install -r requirements/desktop.txt
```

### For Base Dependencies Only
```bash
pip install -r requirements/base.txt
