# Config Import Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing an `ImportError: cannot import name 'load_config' from 'config'` error. This was caused by a conflict between two different config systems:

1. **Legacy config system**: `config.py` file containing `load_config()` function
2. **New config system**: `config/` package directory with `AppSettings` class

## Root Cause
- Files were trying to import `load_config` from the `config` package (directory)
- But `load_config` was actually located in the `config.py` file
- The `config/__init__.py` file didn't export `load_config`

## Solution
1. **Created `config/legacy_config.py`**: Moved the `load_config()` function and `AppConfig` class from `config.py` to the config package
2. **Updated `config/__init__.py`**: Added import and export of `load_config` from the legacy config module
3. **Maintained backward compatibility**: All existing imports continue to work without changes

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `config/legacy_config.py` - Contains the legacy `load_config()` function and `AppConfig` class

### Modified Files
- `config/__init__.py` - Added import and export of `load_config`

## Files That Were Affected
The following files were importing `load_config` and are now working correctly:
- `models/erp_file_processor.py`
- `desktop_config.py`
- `tests/test_erp_file_processor.py`
- `tests/test_basic.py`

## Testing
- ✅ `from config import load_config` - Works
- ✅ `from config import AppSettings` - Works
- ✅ `load_config()` function execution - Works
- ✅ `AppSettings()` instantiation - Works
- ✅ No linting errors

## Benefits
1. **Fixed ImportError**: All config imports now work correctly
2. **Maintained Compatibility**: No changes needed to existing code
3. **Better Organization**: Config functionality is now properly organized in the config package
4. **Future-Proof**: Easy to migrate to the new AppSettings system when ready

## Next Steps (Optional)
- The old `config.py` file can be removed once all references are migrated
- Consider migrating from `load_config()` to `AppSettings` for new code
- The legacy config system can be deprecated in future versions
