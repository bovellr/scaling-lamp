# Data Validation Fix Summary - NaN Filtering

## Problem Identified

**Issue**: Despite data cleaning in the ERP file processor, NaN and invalid data was still appearing in the ERP transactions table and being used in reconciliation.

**Root Cause**: The data validation was happening in the file processor, but the data was being passed to the UI without proper validation at the TransactionData creation level. The `_build_transaction` function was creating TransactionData objects even with invalid data.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Enhanced Transaction Building with Validation

**File Modified**: `views/widgets/erp_data_widget.py`

**Changes**:
- Added comprehensive validation in `_build_transaction` function
- Added checks for NaN values in date, amount, and description fields
- Added filtering for zero amounts and empty descriptions
- Added proper data cleaning before creating TransactionData objects
- Added logging to track how many transactions are filtered out

**Key Validation Logic**:
```python
# Skip if date is NaN or invalid
if pd.isna(date_val) or date_val is None:
    logger.debug("Skipping transaction with invalid date")
    return None

# Skip if amount is NaN, None, or 0
if pd.isna(amount_val) or amount_val is None or float(amount_val) == 0:
    logger.debug("Skipping transaction with invalid amount")
    return None

# Skip if description is NaN or empty
if pd.isna(description_val) or not str(description_val).strip():
    logger.debug("Skipping transaction with invalid description")
    return None
```

### 2. Added TransactionData Validation

**File Modified**: `models/data_models.py`

**Changes**:
- Added `__post_init__` method to validate data after TransactionData creation
- Added `_validate` method to check for invalid values
- Added validation for date, description, and amount fields
- Added checks for NaN, None, and empty values
- Added validation for zero amounts

**Validation Rules**:
- Date cannot be empty, NaN, or None
- Description cannot be empty, NaN, or None
- Amount cannot be NaN, None, or zero
- Amount must be a valid number

### 3. Enhanced Logging and Tracking

**Added Features**:
- Detailed logging of filtered transactions
- Count of valid vs invalid transactions
- Debug logging for each validation failure
- Clear reporting of data quality issues

## Expected Results

### 1. ERP Table Display
- ✅ No more NaN or invalid data in the table
- ✅ Only valid transactions with proper dates, amounts, and descriptions
- ✅ Clear filtering of invalid rows

### 2. Data Quality
- ✅ All TransactionData objects are validated at creation
- ✅ Invalid data is filtered out before reaching the UI
- ✅ Better data quality for reconciliation

### 3. Reconciliation Process
- ✅ Only valid transactions are used for matching
- ✅ No NaN values affecting the matching algorithm
- ✅ Better match quality due to clean data

## Files Modified

### Data Processing
- `views/widgets/erp_data_widget.py` - Enhanced transaction building with validation
- `models/data_models.py` - Added TransactionData validation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Load ERP Data**: Verify no NaN values appear in the table
2. **Check Logs**: Look for filtering statistics in the logs
3. **Run Reconciliation**: Should see better match quality
4. **Data Validation**: All transactions should have valid data

## Summary

The fixes ensure that invalid data (NaN, empty, or zero values) is filtered out at the source when creating TransactionData objects. This prevents invalid data from reaching the UI table and the reconciliation process, ensuring better data quality throughout the application.

The validation happens at multiple levels:
1. **File Processing**: Initial cleaning in the ERP file processor
2. **Transaction Building**: Validation when creating TransactionData objects
3. **Data Model**: Validation in the TransactionData class itself

This multi-layered approach ensures that no invalid data can slip through to cause issues in the UI or reconciliation process.
